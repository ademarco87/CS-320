How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  To ensure functionality and security, it is important to implement thorough testing. Initially, in my Contact service, the JUnit tests did not fully execute as intended, with only half of them functioning correctly. This highlighted the need for debugging and refining the test cases to ensure full coverage and functionality. By revisiting the code, identifying errors, and reworking the tests, I was able to ensure that all scenarios were appropriately tested, including edge cases and invalid inputs. Additionally, following secure coding practices, such as input validation and proper handling of exceptions, strengthened the security of the program. Peer reviews and the use of static analysis tools further ensured that potential vulnerabilities were identified and addressed, improving the overall reliability and security of the application.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  Interpreting user needs involves active engagement with stakeholders through interviews, surveys, and feedback sessions to gather clear and detailed requirements. Clear requirements are easier to translate into actionable features by creating user stories, personas, and use cases that align with the stakeholders' goals. Prototyping and iterative feedback help refine the program and ensure it meets user expectations, much like how Professor Tuft recommended an article to improve my understanding of using the coverage tool effectively (Feedback). Agile methodologies, such as Scrum, enable developers to work in iterative cycles, incorporate feedback at every stage, and adapt the program based on evolving user needs. This approach ensures that the software remains user-focused, functional, and aligned with its intended purpose.

How do I approach designing software?
  Sofware design begins with defining a problem and gathering requirements to establish a clear goal. Prototypes, such as a UML or wireframes, help conceptulize designs and align it with user needs. Modular and scalable architecture should be utilized for future enhancements. Iterative design process, supported with user feedback, collaborative input from both developers and stakeholders, ensure that software is both functional and maintainable. Prioritizing usability, security, and performance in the design ensures a robust final product.


**** I have included the final project to demonstrate the learning process, including identifying and fixing errors to improve functionality and meet requirements. By refining my approach, addressing issues such as incomplete test coverage, and implementing feedback effectively, I was able to showcase my growth in understanding software development principles and applying them to create a fully functional and reliable program.
